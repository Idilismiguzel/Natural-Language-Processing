    "## Model Overview: Character-Level RNN\n",
    "the model we will use here is a character-level RNN since the cipher seems to work on the character level. In a machine translation scenerio, a word-level RNN is the more common choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "A character-level RNN will take as input an integer referring to a specific character and output another integer. To be able to get our model to work, we'll need to preprocess our dataset in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Isolating each character as an array element (instead of an entire phrase or word being the element of the array)\n",
    "2. Tokenizing the characters so we can turn them from letters to integers and vice-versa\n",
    "3. Padding the strings so that all the inputs and outputs can fit in matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize this processing, let's assume either our source sequences (`codes` in this case) or target sequences (`plaintext` in this case) look like this (a list of strings):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"list_1.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this model will be working on the character level, we'll need to separate each string into a list of characters (implicitly done by the tokenizer in this notebook):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"list_2.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the process of tokenization will turn each character into an integer.  Note that when you're working on the a word-level RNN (as in most machine translation examples), the tokenizer will assign an integer to each word rather than each letter, and each cell would represent a word rather than a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"list_3.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning platforms expect the input to be a matrix rather than a list of lists. To turn the input into a matrix, we need to find the longest member of the list, and pad all shorter sequences with 0. Assuming 'and two' is the longest sequence in this example, the matrix ends up looking like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"padded_list.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing (IMPLEMENT)\n",
    "For a neural network to predict on text data, it first has to be turned into data it can understand. Text data like \"dog\" is a sequence of ASCII character encodings.  Since a neural network is a series of multiplication and addition operations, the input data needs to be number(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can turn each character into a number or each word into a number.  These are called character and word ids, respectively.  Character ids are used for character level models that generate text predictions for each character.  A word level model uses word ids that generate text predictions for each word.  Word level models tend to learn better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn each sentence into a sequence of words ids using Keras's [`Tokenizer`](https://keras.io/preprocessing/text/#tokenizer) function. Since we're working on the character level, make sure to set the `char_level` flag to the appropriate value. Then, fit the tokenizer on x.\n"
